# Canadian-Wellbeing
This repo analyzes the distribution of Canadians' health levels and stress levels in 2016, together with the factors that correlate with Canadians' health and stress levels, using data from the 2016 Canadian General Social Survey. We found that eat habits, alcohol consumption habits, and living standards all seem to be correlated with people's health conditions; job satisfaction, sex, and income are all correlated with people's stress levels. We hope that the Canadian government could put more emphasis on promoting work-life balance and help the nation reach a better overall health level.
